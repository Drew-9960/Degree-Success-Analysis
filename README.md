# README for Job In Degree

## Overview

This Jupyter notebook performs a statistical analysis of survey data related to job satisfaction and degree attainment. The analysis aims to uncover trends and insights regarding how different degrees influence job satisfaction among respondents.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from a survey conducted on job satisfaction and degree attainment. It includes various demographic and professional information about the respondents, including their degrees and job satisfaction levels.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Import and Cleaning**:
    - The dataset is imported into the notebook.
    - Initial data cleaning is performed to handle missing values, incorrect data types, and other inconsistencies.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Summary statistics of the dataset are generated.
    - Visualizations are created to understand the distribution of key variables and their relationships.

3. **Statistical Tests**:
    - Various statistical tests are conducted to identify significant differences and correlations between degrees and job satisfaction.
    - Tests include t-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA, depending on the nature of the variables.

4. **Regression Analysis**:
    - Multiple regression models are built to predict job satisfaction based on degree attainment and other relevant factors.
    - Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as R-squared and adjusted R-squared.

5. **Results and Interpretation**:
    - The results of the statistical tests and regression models are interpreted.
    - Insights and trends are discussed, highlighting the impact of degree attainment on job satisfaction.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you need the following packages:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scipy`
- `statsmodels`

You can install these packages using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy statsmodels
```

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Drew-9960/Statistical-Analysis.git
```
2. Navigate to the directory:
```bash
cd Statistical-Analysis
```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook 414Survey_Job_In_Degree_071122.ipynb
```

## Results

The analysis reveals the following key findings:
- Significant correlations between certain degrees and job satisfaction levels.
- Degrees in certain fields have a stronger positive impact on job satisfaction.
- Regression models suggest that other factors, in addition to degree attainment, play a significant role in job satisfaction.

## Conclusion
